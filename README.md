Read, study, and code up examples from Chapters 1-3 of our textbook. A PDF of our textbook is on Canvas, as well as the HTML version, and distinct chapters and their PowerPoints are in the module.

Get comfortable with setting up python on your machine and runnig Python scripts from the command line (as Dr. Chuck does in his videos) as well as running Python in PyCharm.

Submit any and all code you create for this module to the GitHub Classroom remote repository. If you created 10 small python scripts and named them script01.py app.py, test02.py - or whatever - push all those Python files to this (your) remote repo.
